ERROR: Cannot install -r requirements.txt (line 23), -r requirements.txt (line 25), -r requirements.txt (line 9) and numpy==2.2.2 because these package versions have conflicting dependencies.

The conflict is caused by:
    The user requested numpy==2.2.2
    contourpy 1.3.1 depends on numpy>=1.23
    matplotlib 3.10.1 depends on numpy>=1.23
    numba 0.61.0 depends on numpy<2.2 and >=1.24

To fix this you could try to:
1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
2. remove package versions to allow pip attempt to solve the dependency conflict

ERROR: ResolutionImpossible: for help visit https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/topics/dependency-resolution/#dealing-with-dependency-conflicts

[notice] A new release of pip available: 22.2.2 -> 25.0.1
